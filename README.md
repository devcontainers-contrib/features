## Usage

![VS Code](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=VS+Code&color=007ACC&logo=Visual+Studio+Code&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Codespaces&color=181717&logo=GitHub&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![Devcontainers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Devcontainers&color=2496ED&logo=Docker&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

📄 [Complete feature list]

Just add a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file with a `features` key. It's
very similar to `package.json`'s `dependencies` object, just with the addition
of an `options` object.

📚 Make sure to inspect each feature for feature-specific options!

```json
{
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/universal",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers-contrib/features/deno:": {},
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers-contrib/features/neovim": {}
  }
}
```

Then, after adding your devcontainer config file, you can open it in GitHub
Codespaces, or [open it locally using VS Code]. Be warned some features will
compile things from source code and may take a while!

➕ Looking to add a new feature? Check out the [contributing guide]!

This project uses a devcontainer config to outline the development environment.
We also provide various VS Code customizations for your coding pleasure.

To get started, create a GitHub Codespace on a copy of this repository. From
there, the [dev wiki] provides information about adding features, layout,
conventions, etc. When or if you want to contribute your changes back to this
repository, you can follow the [contributing guide]. Happy coding! 👋
