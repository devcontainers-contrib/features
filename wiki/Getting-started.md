This repository uses GitHub and devcontainers, which means it works flawlessly
with GitHub Codespaces! Just click the <kbd>Open in GitHub Codespaces</kbd>
button above to get started.

After opening, you will be greeted with a VS Code web instance that has full
access to the preconfigured devcontainer with all the scripts, build tasks, and
extensions that that entails.

## Getting started with VS Code Dev Containers

[![Open in VS Code with Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Open%20in%20VS%20Code%20with%20Dev%20Containers&color=007ACC&logo=Visual+Studio+Code&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/devcontainers-contrib/features)

If you prefer a more offline experience instead of GitHub Codespaces, VS Code
has an extension just for you! As long as you have
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, you should be able to install
[the Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
and clone the project into a local container volume.
