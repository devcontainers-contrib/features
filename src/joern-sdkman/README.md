# Joern (via SDKMAN) (joern-sdkman)

Joern is a platform for analyzing source code, bytecode, and binary executables.
It generates code property graphs (CPGs), a graph representation of code for
cross-language code analysis. Code property graphs are stored in a custom graph
database. This allows code to be mined using search queries formulated in a
Scala-based domain-specific query language. Joern is developed with the goal of
providing a useful tool for vulnerability discovery and research in static
program analysis.
