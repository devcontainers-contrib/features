# Layrry (via SDKMAN) (layrry-sdkman)

Layrry - A Launcher and API for Modularized Java Applications. It allows to
assemble modularized applications based on Maven artifact coordinates of the
(modular) JARs to include. Layrry utilizes the Java Module System's notion of
module layers, allowing multiple versions of one module to be used within an
application at the same time, as well as dynamically adding and removing modules
at application runtime.
