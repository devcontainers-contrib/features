# Scala (via SDKMAN) (scala-sdkman)

Scala is a programming language for general software applications. Scala has
full support for functional programming and a very strong static type system.
This allows programs written in Scala to be very concise and thus smaller in
size than other general-purpose programming languages. Scala source code is
intended to be compiled to Java bytecode, so that the resulting executable code
runs on a Java virtual machine. Java libraries may be used directly in Scala
code and vice versa. Scala is object-oriented, and uses a curly-brace syntax.
Scala has many features of functional programming languages, including currying,
type inference, immutability, lazy evaluation, and pattern matching. It also has
an advanced type system supporting algebraic data types, covariance and
contravariance, higher-order types, and anonymous types. Other features of Scala
include operator overloading, optional parameters, named parameters, raw
strings, and no checked exceptions.
