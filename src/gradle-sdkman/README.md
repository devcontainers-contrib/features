# Gradle (via SDKMAN) (gradle-sdkman)

Gradle is a build automation tool that builds upon the concepts of Apache Ant
and Apache Maven and introduces a Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL)
instead of the more traditional XML form of declaring the project configuration.
Gradle uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to determine the order in which tasks
can be run.

## Example Usage

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers-contrib/features/gradle-sdkman:2": {}
}
```

| Options Id | Description | Type | Default Value |
