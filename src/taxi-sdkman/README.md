# Taxi (via SDKMAN) (taxi-sdkman)

Taxi is a language for documenting data - such as data models - and the
contracts of APIs. It describes data semantically, allowing powerful tooling to
discover and map data based on it's meaning, rather than the name of a field.

## Example Usage

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers-contrib/features/taxi-sdkman:2": {}
}
```

## Options

| Options Id | Description | Type | Default Value |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| version | Select the version of Taxi to install. | string | latest |
| jdkVersion | Select or enter a JDK version to install. | string | latest |
| jdkDistro | Select or enter a JDK distribution to install | string | ms |
